# Decentralised-System-of-Banking

## Idea
## Decentralised System of Banking for Fund Raising

### To create a decentralised fund raising application for the startups, on Ethereum using blockchain technology.

#### Problems with today's fundraising application like KickStarter and Ketto.

The contributors and the donators have no knowledge of where their donated money is being used at or for. They have no control
of their raised funds once the contribution have been made. According to a research, 9% of the projects on KickStarter fail to deliver the product. The person who started the funding campaign may use the funds for his/her personal needs thereby dissolving the essence of whole fund raising idea.
